# lxml_html_clean

## Motivation

This project was initially a part of [lxml](https://github.com/lxml/lxml). Because HTML cleaner is designed as blocklist-based, many reports about possible security vulnerabilities were filed for lxml and that make the project problematic for security-sensitive environments. Therefore we decided to extract the problematic part to a separate project.

## Installation

You can install this project directly via `pip install lxml_html_clean` or soon as an extra of lxml
itself via `pip install lxml[html_clean]`. Both ways installs this project together with lxml itself.

## Usage

[USAGE.rst](USAGE.rst) contains a part of the lxml documentation related to HTML cleaning.
